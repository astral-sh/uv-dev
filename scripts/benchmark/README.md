# benchmark

Benchmarking scripts for uv and other package management tools.

Immutable package artifacts and ecosystem lockfiles for benchmark development are listed in
`fixtures.json`. From the repository root, run `python3 scripts/benchmark/prepare-fixtures.py` to
download them into `.cache/bench-fixtures`. The script verifies every fixture against its recorded
SHA-256, including files already present.

`walltime-shards.py` assigns every built walltime suite to exactly one of up to eight independent
runs. The saved plan is checked against the extracted benchmark binaries before execution, so a
missing or stale artifact cannot silently reduce coverage. Each shard retains its own CodSpeed
profile for main-branch baseline imports.

## Getting Started

From the `scripts/benchmark` directory:

```shell
uv run resolver \
    --uv-pip \
    --poetry \
    --benchmark \
    resolve-cold \
    ../requirements/trio.in
```
